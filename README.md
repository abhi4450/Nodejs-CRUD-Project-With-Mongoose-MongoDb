The app performs CRUD operations on product resources using a JSON
Server as a fake REST API backend. Enables users to perform all essential
CRUD operations, including adding new products, viewing product
details, updating existing products, and deleting products from the
inventory. Asynchronous tasks are smoothly handled using the Fetch
API, ensuring seamless communication between the React frontend and
the JSON Server backend. Leverages the power of React's useState hook
to manage the state of components efficiently.
